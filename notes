group by and having exercise my solution:

SELECT students.name as student, count(assignment_submissions.*) as total_submissions
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
where students.end_date is null
GROUP BY students.name;

SELECT students.name as student, count(assignment_submissions.*) as total_submissions
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
where students.end_date is null
GROUP BY students.name
having count(assignment_submissions.*) < 100;

plz note group by can make use of alias while having can not as "The HAVING clause is evaluated before the SELECT so we can't use the alias total_submissions alias that is created in the SELECT." [ W5D1 groupBy having note]
